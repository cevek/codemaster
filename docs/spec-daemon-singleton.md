# Spec: one warm daemon — singleton orchestrator + orphan-free MCP servers

Status: **implemented** (Stage 1 + Stage 2). Realizes the process topology ARCHITECTURE.md §2 and
the §19 "daemon singleton" decision. The `Transport` seam lives in `support/transport/`
(unix-socket impl + NDJSON framing); the daemon in `daemon/daemon-server.ts`, the bridge +
convergence in `bin.ts` (`mcp` command) + `daemon/connect-or-spawn.ts` + `daemon/remote-orchestrator.ts`.
The one residual — reaping a **permanently wedged** daemon — is tracked in `docs/backlog.md` and needs
process-mode engine isolation (§9), out of scope here.

## 1. Problem & evidence

ARCHITECTURE.md §2 promises **one** long-lived front-door process that "amortizes the
expensive warm state (the `ts` plugin's LS chiefly) across every agent call in a session"
and "serves many agents across many workspaces." §19 specifies the convergence mechanism
(atomic bind-or-connect on a socket, stale-socket recovery). **Neither is implemented.**

Today (`src/bin.ts` `case 'mcp'`): `buildOrchestrator()` constructs a fresh **in-process**
`Orchestrator` (registry + engines + warm LS) inside the process, and `serveMcp` exposes it
over a **`StdioServerTransport`**. There is no socket, no lockfile, no bind-or-connect (grep:
no `listen(`/`EADDRINUSE`/lockfile anywhere). An MCP-over-stdio server is, by protocol, **one
child process per client connection** — so every Claude session / editor window / **worktree**
that connects spawns its own orchestrator with its own multi-GB LS, sharing nothing.

Two distinct failures result:

1. **No amortization (the §2 promise is false today).** N concurrent connections = N cold
   starts + N independent warm LSes. On a large repo that is N × gigabytes — exactly the
   OOM risk §9 exists to bound, multiplied by connection count.
2. **Orphan accumulation.** Observed in the field: **26** live `node bin.ts mcp` processes.
   `serveMcp` _does_ wire clean shutdown (`stdin.on('end')` → dispose+exit, `server.onclose`,
   SIGTERM/SIGINT). It fails to fire when the **in-process event loop is blocked by a heavy
   synchronous LS call** (in-process mode "blocks the shared loop", §2) so a queued stdin-EOF
   is never processed; or when the parent is `SIGKILL`ed without cleanly closing the pipe; or
   when the stdin write-end leaks to another process so EOF never arrives. A blocked or
   missed-EOF server has **no idle deadline**, so it lives forever. The worktree-spam workflow
   (§8/§9/§18) drives the connection count, and orphans pile up across sessions.

The honesty cost: §2/§19 currently **assert the singleton as existing**. That is doc-drift
(a claim the code contradicts) and must be reconciled (§8 below).

## 2. The model — singleton daemon + thin stdio bridge

Split the one fat per-connection process into **two roles**, exactly as §2's "front door vs
engine" seam already implies:

- **The daemon** — one long-lived process per machine (per user). Holds the `repoId → engine`
  registry, the warm LS(es), lifecycle (idle-TTL / path-existence / governor — §9, unchanged),
  and listens on a **unix socket** speaking newline-delimited JSON (§18). It only routes; heavy
  work lives in the engines it owns (in-process for now; the §2 `process`-mode child split is a
  **separate** roadmap item, not this spec).
- **The bridge** — what `codemaster mcp` becomes: a **dumb** stdio↔socket proxy. It speaks MCP
  over stdio to the client and forwards each request to the daemon over the socket, streaming the
  reply back. It holds **no project state and does no heavy work**, so its event loop is never
  blocked — `stdin 'end'` is always processed promptly. One bridge per client connection (cheap);
  one daemon shared by all bridges.

**Convergence (§19, atomic bind-or-connect).** On `mcp` start the bridge tries to **connect** to
the socket; on `ENOENT`/`ECONNREFUSED` (no daemon, or a stale socket file) it performs a liveness
probe, `unlink`s a stale socket, and **binds** — becoming (or spawning) the daemon. A concurrent
launch racing on `EADDRINUSE` loses and connects to the winner. Net: exactly one daemon, every
bridge converges on it.

**Socket path (§19).** A short, hashed path under the user runtime dir (or `os.tmpdir()`),
length-asserted at bind to stay under `sun_path`'s ~104/108-byte limit. A `Transport` seam
(mirroring `ProjectHost`, §2) so a Windows named-pipe impl drops in later (§4).

## 3. Lifecycle & orphan-freedom (this is what kills the 26)

- **Bridge exits on client disconnect, always.** Because the bridge does no heavy work, a blocked
  loop can never swallow `stdin 'end'`. On EOF / socket error it exits immediately. A dead bridge
  never touches the daemon's warm state.
- **Daemon idle self-exit — a hard deadline, not EOF-dependent.** The daemon exits after
  `daemon.idleEvictionMinutes` with **zero open bridge connections and no in-flight requests**,
  then `unlink`s its socket. This is the belt-and-suspenders that makes an immortal orphan
  impossible: even if every disconnect signal were missed, the idle timer (its own loop is free
  when idle) terminates it. Next `mcp` start respawns it (cheap, lazy — §9).
- **Engine eviction unchanged but now shared.** Idle-TTL eviction, the path-existence sweeper, and
  the memory governor (§9) run **once** in the daemon over the shared engine set — so worktree
  churn evicts engines centrally instead of leaking a whole orchestrator per worktree.
- **Stale-socket recovery (§19).** A `SIGKILL`ed daemon leaves a dangling socket file; the next
  bridge's connect fails, it probes liveness, `unlink`s, and rebinds — no hang, no manual cleanup.
- **Self-staleness banner preserved.** The `src/**` fingerprint that drives the "reconnect MCP"
  banner (spec-status-as-the-doc, §3.6) is taken at **daemon** spawn; reconnecting a bridge does
  not refresh it (the daemon is the long-lived code) — so the banner still tells the agent when the
  daemon predates an edit. The daemon's own idle-exit naturally clears stale code over time.

## 4. Transport seam

A `Transport` interface (`listen`/`connect`/`send`/`onMessage`/`close`) with a unix-socket impl
now and a named-pipe impl later, mirroring the `ProjectHost` two-impl pattern (§2). The daemon and
bridge both speak `Transport`, never a concrete socket — flipping platforms never touches
orchestrator code.

## 5. The CLI one-shot path stays one-shot (do NOT route it through the daemon)

`codemaster op …` / `codemaster status` are **deliberately** fresh short-lived processes that build
an in-process orchestrator, answer, and exit — the self-dev loop (CONTRIBUTING "Self-dev loop")
relies on each invocation reflecting the **current source** with no daemon to reconnect. Only the
long-lived `mcp` command joins the socket daemon. Keep `buildOrchestrator()` usable inline for
(a) the CLI one-shot, (b) tests, (c) an explicit `--in-process` escape hatch for debugging the
daemon without the socket. The socket daemon is a `mcp`-only concern.

## 6. Staging (each independently shippable)

- **Stage 1 — stop the bleeding (orphan-reaping on the pre-singleton model). ✅ shipped.** An
  **idle self-exit hard deadline** (`common/async/idle-exit.ts`, a generic Clock-based deadline: a
  hold cancels it, the last release re-arms, it never fires while a hold is active). On the
  `--in-process` serve path a hold = an in-flight request → the server can't be reaped mid-call;
  TTL = `daemon.idleEvictionMinutes` (with the `CODEMASTER_MCP_IDLE_MS` test override). Bounds an
  orphan's life to the TTL once the loop is free; a **permanently** wedged sync loop stays out of
  scope. The CLI one-shot path (§5) never serves, so no timer leaks into it.
- **Stage 2 — the singleton (amortization + convergence). ✅ shipped.** The §2–§4 daemon + bridge
  split: `support/transport/` (seam + unix socket + NDJSON), `daemon/daemon-server.ts` (hosts one
  in-process orchestrator, routes per-message async), `daemon/remote-orchestrator.ts` (the bridge's
  forwarding `OrchestratorApi`, reply-deadline bounded), `daemon/connect-or-spawn.ts` (bind-or-connect
  convergence + stale-socket recovery), `daemon/spawn-daemon.ts` (detached spawn). The daemon's
  idle-exit reuses the Stage-1 deadline with hold = open bridge connection, subsuming Stage 1 at the
  daemon level. `codemaster mcp` is now the bridge; `--in-process` is the escape hatch.

Stage 1 is worth landing first: the 26 are dominated by orphans from sequential worktree churn, which
Stage 1 alone collapses to at-most-one-per-active-client.

## 7. Tests (§16 — independent oracles; determinism via injectable clock + a socket-dir seam)

No `sleep` in any of these — drive the injected `Clock` and a socket-dir seam (mirroring the watcher
seam, §16). One real-socket smoke test, like the chokidar smoke test.

## 8. Doc reconciliation (done with the code)

- ARCHITECTURE.md §2 and §19 are present-tense: the singleton/bind-or-connect is built, with the
  honest scope that a permanently wedged daemon is not reaped (process-mode, separate roadmap).
- plan.md's deferred bullet (`daemon singleton (bind-or-connect)`) points here; check its box per
  stage.

## 9. Non-goals

- **`process`-mode engine isolation** (one child process per workspace, §2/§9) — orthogonal; this
  spec shares ONE in-process orchestrator across bridges. Per-workspace process isolation is its own
  roadmap item and composes on top (the daemon would own the child engines).
- **Windows named pipe in v1** — seam only (§4); unix socket ships first.
- **Cross-machine / networked daemon** — local socket only; the inbox-style "never leaves the
  machine" stance holds.
- **Persisting warm state across daemon restarts** — still cold-start on respawn (§8/§18 disk-snapshot
  rationale unchanged).
